# Cat-Breed-image-classification-using-CNN

Build a cat breed image classification model with the architecture specified below.  
**Dataset** - https://www.kaggle.com/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset

● The classifier should only be trained on these 10 breeds : Bombay, Calico, Burmese, Himalayan,
Munchkin, ragdoll, siberian, British shorthair, Russian Blue, Dilute Calico.

● Any of these frameworks can be used : Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Caffee.

● The classifier should only be built using Inception CNN architecture.

● Evaluation metrics i.e Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, ROC-AUC Score shall be calculated
on test data.

● The entire process should be clearly logged in a Jupyter Notebook and uploaded to a public github
repo, the exact link to this notebook is to be submitted as a result of this assignment.
